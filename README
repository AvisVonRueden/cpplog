A simple, header-only C++ logging library.  Comes with a set of tests to ensure correct functionality.

The layout of this library is based on Google's logging library (http://code.google.com/p/google-glog/), but does not use any code copied from that project.

NOTE: Tests are relatively complete, but not exhaustive.  Please use at your own risk, and feel free to submit bug reports.
